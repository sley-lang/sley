# Sley 2 — Machine Genesis

Sley 2 is a new, incompatible programming-system lineage in which programs are
created, stored, changed, executed, tested, versioned, and exchanged as typed
semantic state. Its canonical program form is SSMC1, its canonical encoding is
SCB1, and its machine interface is SMP1.

The governing doctrine is: **machines do not write source; they mutate verified
program state**. This repository therefore contains no Sley source parser,
canonical text format, formatter, conventional LSP, or compatibility promise
for Sley 1.x.

## Current phase

Phase M0 is complete. M1 packages S20-100 through S20-170 now provide SCB1,
typed identifiers, an independent oracle, schema epochs, the immutable object
store, deterministic state roots, and uncompressed root/object repository
packs. S20-180 and the scoped M1 core/adversarial/fuzz-smoke profiles now pass.
M2 is in progress: S20-200 freezes the SSMC1 entity/opcode schema and S20-210
implements the deterministic core type system. S20-220 now provides bounded,
deterministic CFG and value-use validation, and S20-230 adds exact least-fixed-
point effect closure with static scope typing. S20-240 now enforces a restricted
epoch-1 contract/test profile and deterministic policy-incomplete test planning;
its full-GA schema gaps remain explicit. S20-250 now adds deterministic
TypeDef/Function semantic fingerprints, a domain-separated canonical value
hash, and exact impact relationships for the twelve modeled semantic-core
kinds. Its six unmodeled entity bodies remain an explicit full-GA blocker.
S20-260 now provides a restricted deterministic O0 lowering profile for all
five terminators and the three validated Boolean opcodes, with exact derived
bytes and a root/profile-bound cache key. The other 52 opcode signatures,
generics, and adapters remain fail-closed gaps. S20-270 now executes that
restricted bytecode deterministically with exact Boolean semantics, all five
terminators, bounded fuel/value/output/cancellation behavior, and a canonical
observation digest. S20-280 now adds eight restricted deterministic,
request-owned reference adapter fixtures with exact identity, state, replay,
limit, atomicity, and transcript rules. VM adapter opcodes, live host access,
protected capabilities, live cancellation, and persistent report semantics
remain explicit gaps. S20-290 now provides restricted derived execution/test
report envelopes that verify VM observations and compare selected expectations
without claiming canonical persistence, policy/resource finality, test pass,
or the M2 exit. S20-300 now adds a restricted `SLEYIDX1` index-snapshot
conformance profile whose candidate records can match only an already-fresh
explicit modeled-request rebuild. It provides no trusted cache hydration,
root-provenance proof, query authority, or full S20-300/M3 completion. S20-310
now adds four restricted typed queries over opaque freshly derived
snapshots, with exact QueryId/response records and hard failure when limits
would omit facts. It does not claim the nineteen root-backed query classes,
truncation/continuation, capsules, SMP1, full S20-310, or M3 completion. S20-320
now adds a separately identified restricted evidence capsule for those complete
responses, with exact raw-ID dictionaries and direct-edge tables but fixed
no-omission, no-truncation, and no-continuation status. It is not the master
context capsule and adds no workspace/root/session authority. Every next
package must follow `docs/WORK_PACKAGES.md`. S20-330 is deliberately deferred
until negotiated session and verified workspace/root authority exist. S20-340
now generates immutable mutation descriptors for all eighteen SSMC1 entity
kinds and all sixteen primitive classes from the exact frozen manifest. It
provides no candidate construction, executable mutation, validation, policy,
session, commit, or transaction authority. The first decomposed S20-350 slice
now generates closed proposal-only host values for all eighteen entity bodies
and all seventy-five body fields, with no runtime type-name dispatch. A second
slice binds all 179 immutable descriptors to exact closed body/field
discriminants and performs type-selection-only admission. A strict low-level
SCB value cursor now exposes the already-frozen primitive decoder behavior for
later private codec work, including lossless strict 128-bit integer primitives;
it selects no schema or mutation type. A crate-private mutation layer now closes
primitive values, IDs/roots, direct enums, ordered lists/options, canonical
entity-ID sets, and the complete twenty-variant recursive `TypeExpr` family
with depth and allocation budgets. Further private slices close `MemberId`,
value/function references, immediates, CFG edges/cases, trap codes, the four
non-Option terminator records, and the dependency-closed `TypeParameterDef`,
`RecordField`, `BuiltinFailureValue`, `ContractSource`, `ContractBinding`, and
`ResourceLimits` manifest helpers. A bounded body slice also closes the exact
six-field `OperationBody` record. A second dependency-closed body slice covers
`WorkspaceBody`, `PackageBody`, `FunctionBody`, `ParameterBody`,
`GlobalValueBody`, `EffectDefBody`, `AdapterImportBody`, `EntryPointBody`,
`PolicyBindingBody`, and `DependencyBindingBody`, still without exposing a body
or field aggregate codec. An explicitly partial, implementation-independent
mutation-value corpus now pins 126 accepted and 18 rejected vectors across the
landed unambiguous families, including all twenty `TypeExpr` variants, all
eleven closed body records, and exact declared-value coverage for 65 of the 75
manifest fields. Its Python oracle derives and checks exact bytes
without importing, executing, or inspecting the Rust codec; private Rust tests
consume the committed expected bytes and exact rejection codes. This is not
complete 18-body or 75-field conformance: the ten fields that depend on generic
`Option<T>`, `ConstValue`, `Terminator`, or deferred contract/test unions, the
seven deferred bodies, aggregates, preconditions, candidate records, and runtime
surfaces remain explicitly excluded. `TrapTerminator` and the enclosing `Terminator` union
remain unimplemented pending locked-canon resolution of the conflicting SCB1
and manifest `Option<T>` tags. `ConstValue`, complete CFG/body/field codecs,
contract/test families, preconditions, candidate records, and candidate
construction remain deferred. S20-370 now
adds a separately registry-authorized protected policy root with exact opaque
principals, principal-specific grants, protected entity bindings, and mandatory
test/contract finalization. It has no authenticated policy-transition,
candidate, commit, or live runtime authority. S20-380 now adds a narrow
local-only capability-token profile with exact root/effect/scope/adapter/budget
binding, keyed BLAKE3 authentication, caller-owned replay/budget ledger
judgment, and an authorized reference-adapter wrapper. VM adapter opcodes,
candidate admission, commit, sessions, live host confinement, policy
transitions, providers, deployment, and GA remain explicit gaps.
S20-345 now freezes the missing candidate/value/precondition/capability-summary/
validation-profile/expiry contracts as proposal-only specifications. It adds
no builder, decoder, validation, authority, root construction, or commit path;
its identifier domains/vectors and independent Nabu/Vulcan reviews now pass.
S20-350 remains incomplete and cannot yet construct a candidate.
S20-710 now has a deterministic offline pre-release dependency inventory and a
bounded high-confidence secret scan. Those local checks do not complete the
package: operator-approved proprietary root license text, a standards SBOM,
release provenance, a release-candidate history re-anchor, and final Argus and
Vulcan dispositions remain mandatory.
S20-700 has one bounded incremental schema-import slice: 512 deterministic
inputs and an exact registry no-fallback test. It is not a persistent fuzz
harness. A second bounded regression proves authorized adapter state-root,
effect, and adapter binding confusion fails before ledger charge or fixture
mutation. A third Unix-only regression rejects symlinked object-store roots and
fan-out directories across put, read, and recovery without writing outside the
store. A fourth bounded mutation-value slice exercises all 126 currently
supported accepted fixtures through 252 trailing-byte and 446 distinct proper-
prefix mutations with panic containment and deterministic errors, while the 18
committed rejection vectors retain exact codes. It does not cover the blocked
`Option<T>`, `ConstValue`, aggregate, candidate, or runtime surfaces. These
slices do not complete the required cross-surface adversarial suite. Five
honest persistent targets now cover the SCB1 decoder, direct `SLEYEP01` schema
bootstrap importer, S20-170 repository-pack importer, public typed S20-210 type
checker, and public typed S20-220 graph/CFG validator. The pack target has a
direct-input lane and a rehashed-trailer lane that reaches beyond the outer
digest check while preserving failed-preflight no-write assertions. The two
semantic-checker targets use bounded fuzz-only typed constructors, not a
parallel canonical decoder or the private mutation codec. Their 512-node type
budget retains minimized harness-OOM input `S20-700-HARNESS-001` as a closed
regression. The scoped `*-persistent-fuzz-smoke` Make targets use installed
Clang/nightly runtimes, generate deterministic fixture-derived or synthetic
corpora as documented, and record runtime evidence under `evidence/runtime/`.
The matching runners document their manual indefinite-run form.

## Authority boundaries

This repository is local-only. No push, tag, upload, deployment, publication,
provider spend, or public claim is authorized. Sley 1.2 deployment and release
work belongs to a separate session and repository worktree.

## Validation

`make quick` and `make check-changed` validate the implemented M0/M1 and
current M2 type-system/CFG/effect/restricted-contract/fingerprint/lowering/
execution/reference-adapter/report-envelope/index-snapshot/restricted-query/
restricted-capsule/mutation-schema/protected-policy-root/capability-token
surface, the closed mutation proposal host model, plus the offline S20-610
raw-baseline evidence contract and bounded
S20-710 pre-release audit (`DEFERRED`, never release `PASS`). Later profiles
are present but intentionally fail closed until their corresponding work
packages land.
`make v2` remains the eventual authoritative full gate.
